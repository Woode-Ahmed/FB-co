NO BRAK


**Project Name: NO BRAK Dashboard Tool

Description:

NO BRAK is a lightweight web-based dashboard tool built with Python and Flask. The tool provides a user-friendly interface for automating Facebook post comments using cookies and access tokens. It features a secure login system, allowing only authorized users to access the dashboard.

Users can input a post ID, set a custom commenter name, upload a text file containing comment lines, and control the delay between each comment to avoid spam detection. The tool automatically fetches the required token from Facebook cookies and manages comment posting in a loop with real-time status feedback.

The entire interface is designed with a modern dark theme background and fully responsive layout, ensuring it works seamlessly across both desktop and mobile devices.
